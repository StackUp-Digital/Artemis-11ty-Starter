# Static Template Generator

The static template generator is a tool designed to help with the creation of static
templates for client projects.

##Â Things to consider

This was created with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a very simple static site generator. Additional documentation can be found on the 11ty website. Assets are compiled with Gulp. The provided gulpfile has been configured to handle the compilation of `.scss` files.

The dependencies have been acquired through [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). Therefore, to get started you will need to install the project dependencies with the following command:

```
yarn install
```

## Useful Scripts

**Run the local web server**

```shell
yarn dev
```

**Run the gulp watch command**

```shell
gulp watch
```

**Build the project for production**

```shell
yarn build
```
